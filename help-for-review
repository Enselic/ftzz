ftzz-generate 
Generate a random directory hierarchy with some number of files

A pseudo-random directory hierarchy will be generated (seeded by this command's input parameters)
containing approximately the target number of files. The exact configuration of files and
directories in the hierarchy is probabilistically determined to mostly match the specified
parameters.

Generated files and directories are named using monotonically increasing numbers, where files are
named `n` and directories are named `n.dir` for a given natural number `n`.

By default, generated files are empty, but random data can be used as the file contents with the
`total-bytes` option.

USAGE:
    ftzz generate [OPTIONS] --files <NUM_FILES> <ROOT_DIR>

ARGS:
    <ROOT_DIR>
            The directory in which to generate files
            
            The directory will be created if it does not exist.

OPTIONS:
    -b, --total-bytes <NUM_BYTES>
            The total amount of random data to be distributed across the generated files
            
            Note: this value is probabilistically respected, meaning any amount of data may be
            generated so long as we attempt to get close to N.
            
            [default: 0]

        --bytes-exact
            Whether or not to generate exactly N bytes

    -d, --max-depth <MAX_DEPTH>
            The maximum directory tree depth
            
            [default: 5]

    -e, --exact
            Whether or not to generate exactly N files and bytes

        --files-exact
            Whether or not to generate exactly N files

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -n, --files <NUM_FILES>
            The number of files to generate
            
            Note: this value is probabilistically respected, meaning any number of files may be
            generated so long as we attempt to get close to N.

    -q, --quiet
            Less output per occurrence

    -r, --ftd-ratio <FILE_TO_DIR_RATIO>
            The number of files to generate per directory (default: files / 1000)
            
            Note: this value is probabilistically respected, meaning not all directories will have N
            files).

        --seed <SEED>
            Change the PRNG's starting seed
            
            For example, you can use bash's `$RANDOM` function.
            
            [default: 0]

    -v, --verbose
            More output per occurrence
